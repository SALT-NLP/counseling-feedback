It really sounds like you can go to them for support and often being there for someone else can make us feel better too.\nSeeker: This was a nice little chat! You should actually volunteer for a helpline haha\nHelper: Aww that's so good of you to say!! I do want to confirm that you have a game-plan now, though. Remember to keep your friends close and to start looking for a new therapist if you haven't already. If you find one that's not the right fit it doesn't hurt to start over or maybe even ask for a recommendation from that therapist. If they're any good they should understand how important it is for you to find a good fit. Also remember to be kind to yourself. It can be difficult, but I know you can do it.\nSeeker: I'm ok! I got my friends and family. I made an appointment with my psychiatrist to get different medication so I could ask him for a therapist recommen dation as well.\nHelper: That's absolutely wonderful to hear! Is there anything else you would like to discuss today?\nSeeker: I think I'm good. Thank you though! This was nice :)\nHelper: Awesome. You've got this! Have a good rest of your day\n\n### Response:", "helper_index": 11, "conv_index": 3}, {"text": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

Specifically, I feel scared and anxious that me, my friends, or my loved ones will be infected\nHelper: That is very understandable. I too have felt this anxiety. It is a very difficult situation, and can really bring out the worst in our mental health.\nSeeker: I see. Sorry to hear that. I don't go out until it's absolutely necessary, only when I have errands or for work. And so for more than half a year, I have not gone out for any frivolous walks, to the movie theatre, for hikes, or to workout s I used to. yes and I feel that. I have pretty much been staying indoors all this time. I feel lonely and sleep at abnormal times, workout a lot less, eat a lot less healthy, etc. There's no coherent or healthy lifestyle pattern, as my life pretty much was put on hold from back in March.\nHelper: Well, it sounds like you are doing pretty well given the circumstances. It is good that you have found activities to keep busy. I understand the lack of structure. It can be difficult but also freeing.\nSeeker: well I have, but a lot of the times I am just wasting time and procrastinating and kind of just staring off into space and not doing much at home. Yes thank you for pointing out the lack of structure, that was the word I was looking for. It was freeing at first, but then I realized that it was going to repeat perpetually and that I was going to miss the entire summer, etc.\nHelper: It can be a good time to try a project or new direction you haven't had time for until now. Or just try to think of what your possibilities are.\nSeeker: and I felt somewhat claustrophobic etc. And also scared to go out and be in public because I get paranoid at who's infected, etc. yeah that's a good idea.\nHelper: I have a good feeling that we will have some normalcy by summer 2021\nSeeker: I wanted to take up writing more, but my online education got in the way and my goal became unrealized. yes hopefully you're right. and how about you? How have you been coping so far?\nHelper: I understand. As long as you are being cautious and following the guidelines, you are doing all you can to protect yourself. That is a good thing.\nSeeker: yes I am trying to be as careful and not think to much as I can.\nHelper: Just taking it one day at a time and focusing on the positives. Obviously some days will be easier than others\n\n### Response:", "helper_index": 7, "conv_index": 8}, {"text": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

And so for more than half a year, I have not gone out for any frivolous walks, to the movie theatre, for hikes, or to workout s I used to. yes and I feel that. I have pretty much been staying indoors all this time. I feel lonely and sleep at abnormal times, workout a lot less, eat a lot less healthy, etc. There's no coherent or healthy lifestyle pattern, as my life pretty much was put on hold from back in March.\nHelper: Well, it sounds like you are doing pretty well given the circumstances. It is good that you have found activities to keep busy. I understand the lack of structure. It can be difficult but also freeing.\nSeeker: well I have, but a lot of the times I am just wasting time and procrastinating and kind of just staring off into space and not doing much at home. Yes thank you for pointing out the lack of structure, that was the word I was looking for. It was freeing at first, but then I realized that it was going to repeat perpetually and that I was going to miss the entire summer, etc.\nHelper: It can be a good time to try a project or new direction you haven't had time for until now. Or just try to think of what your possibilities are.\nSeeker: and I felt somewhat claustrophobic etc. And also scared to go out and be in public because I get paranoid at who's infected, etc. yeah that's a good idea.\nHelper: I have a good feeling that we will have some normalcy by summer 2021\nSeeker: I wanted to take up writing more, but my online education got in the way and my goal became unrealized. yes hopefully you're right. and how about you? How have you been coping so far?\nHelper: I understand. As long as you are being cautious and following the guidelines, you are doing all you can to protect yourself. That is a good thing.\nSeeker: yes I am trying to be as careful and not think to much as I can.\nHelper: Just taking it one day at a time and focusing on the positives. Obviously some days will be easier than others\nSeeker: I see. I was okay for the last few months to be honest, and getting used to the routines. But it was just that for the last two to three weeks, my city started having a rise in the cases from a second wave. And that's when my anxiety came back and my guard is up again\nHelper: Hopefully you can see the light at the end of this tunnel. The second waves seem to be a trend, and we made it through the first one.\nSeeker: yeah that's true and have been lucky so far as I don't know anyone personally that has been infected.\nHelper: That is a good thing!\nSeeker: And have also been lucky that certain things didn't happen, like a massive shortage in supplies and food. There was for the first month or so, but stuff like that were eventually smoothed out. So I agree with you that in due time, things will resolve themselves. I sure can go for that vaccine now, that's for sure.\nHelper: I think you are doing the right thing. And it shouldn't be long before the vaccine is released.\nSeeker: Yeah the highly publicized vaccine company is hopefully going to roll out its vaccine soon in the States.\nHelper: That's promising. Just make sure you are getting your vitamins, and drinking plenty of water. This will keep your immune system strong. It's difficult to remember to take care of yourself when all this is going on.\nSeeker: yes, I get enough of those. Just should have more of a routine, as you said before. I just need to manage my time better at home and also find more time to work out and sleep at normal times, because I tend to sleep real late nowadays. yeah you're so right. That's exactly right, I kind of ignore myself and became zoned out or something.\nHelper: Sleeping patterns can vary. Some studies actually show that certain people are better off with an unpredictable routine. Just listen to your mind and body.\nSeeker: right. That's good advice. But aside from that, I should be fine then. Thank you very much for your helpful input.\nHelper: You are welcome. Thank you for allowing me to try to help!\nSeeker: it's good to have someone to listen and understand, thanks. Thanks again and have a wonderful day.\nHelper: You too!!\nSeeker: good luck and all the best to you.\nHelper: All the best to you too. This will pass.\n\n### Response:", "helper_index": 15, "conv_index": 8}, {"text": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

But you're right, I have to learn to let go and let him fix his own problems with no intereference from me.\nHelper: You are very self aware and have good insight. I notice that you are very in touch with your feelings. You can use writing as a way to release emotions and express yourself, as you are now.\nSeeker: Thank you, I will try that. Like a journal maybe?\nHelper: Yes, I can recommend a journal on Amazon that I also use. Thank you for sharing with me today. Please reach back out anytime.\nSeeker: Thank you so much!

I believe, in this age of technology and social media frenzy, you are not totally cut off from your friends.\nSeeker: Yeah thats true\nHelper: Yes, can you try organizing a virtual get together?\nSeeker: Its just hard to find time to interact with them. I should try that\nHelper: Cool! There are lot of online games that have been invented after the lockdown came into effect.

How do you keep in touch with your freinds?\nHelper: We were missing our colleagues at workplace and we planned an online quiz + dumb charade and it was really enjoyable.\nSeeker: That sounds like a good time :).

But now he's demanding an apology, and it's completely unreasonable...\nHelper: Ah I see .. you feel as though you friend is dragging up things from the past which are no longer relevant to your friendship?\nSeeker: No, not at all. It's new stuff.\nHelper: Oh I am sorry, I misunderstood. Can you tell me a little about the situation?\nSeeker: We've been texting about politics, among other things.

I am feeling very depressed due to work load and current household situation\nHelper: I'm sorry to hear that. Would you like to talk about it?\nSeeker: Yes, due to COVID life is messed up. Work load has increase and more responsibility of household.\nHelper: COVID has really changed a lot of stuff. I understand your frustration. Has your work increased because of COVID conditions. Meaning you have to take extra work, or doing tasks that you dislike to do? If you don't feel comfortable elaborating, we can always talk about how you feel and how you can maybe feel a bit better.\nSeeker: Due to the furlough Company has increased my my work load three times. I am not able to take rest. Getting depressed everday.\nHelper: That sounds really bad. I once worked in a company that placed unnecessary pressure on me, with a low pay. I can relate to how you feel. Do you have to depend on this company for work? Sometimes it's really not worth working somewhere if it's really affecting your mental health.\nSeeker: They are paying me well but It is hard to take the load beside I have family and kids responsibility. I don't have time for them.\nHelper: I understand. But I want you to think about this. Your mental health is more important right now because it is affecting you. And how you feel really affects those around you, especially the ones who love you. If you take some time to think about what is more important to you in life right now can help you make a decision. Working so hard can be a barrier right now. But you may have a bright future plan ahead. If so, that is something you want to look forward to. I know what you are doing is really helping your family. And I know they really appreciate it, even if they don't say it.\nSeeker: I can understand that. But my job is really important right now as my partner lost his in COVID. and he is not doing anything right now not even helping at home. It makes me more low and it is hard to take care of 3 younger kids who are staying at home full time.\nHelper: Ok, I understand better now. Thank you for explaining. What you are telling should to be something you need to discuss with your partner. Do both of you communicate well with each other? Maybe he is not aware of your situation or how you feel.\nSeeker: Nowadays he is so frustrated doesn't like to talk even. Whenever I bring household responsibilities or kids topic, he gets frustrated.\nHelper: Oh no. I can see from his part he feels upset and frustrated because he may feel useless at the moment. But that's not an excuse to neglect responsibilities. You can maybe make him feel more useful around the house by starting to assign him small tasks. Encouraging him to do stuff and rewarding him with words of encouragement. I know it sounds kind of frustrating to do that, but maybe this small step on your half could also help him. Do you have any family member that are close to you? If your partner isn't helpful, maybe seeking help from family can reduce your housework load.\n\n### Response:", "helper_index": 6, "conv_index": 45}, {"text": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

How can I encourage you tonight?\nSeeker: I'm really anxious and I javen. haven't been sleeping lately\nHelper: So you have a lot on your mind and you are losing sleep over it?\nSeeker: Yeah my company laid off 10% of the workforce last Friday and furloughed another 10%. I'm afraid I'm next\nHelper: I'm sorry to hear that. It can be a bit stressful to think you may lose your job.\nSeeker: yeah my mind is racing and I can't stay calm.\nHelper: I have found there are ways to calm myself down when things in my life seem very uncertain.\nSeeker: Really? What seems to work? I'm willing to try anything right now\nHelper: I make a list of the things I can do - And the things I can't. Then you can have goals. And if you can work on a goal, for example, if you need to write a resume, you start working on that a little bit every day until it's done. But if there is nothing you CAN do about the situation, you have to pray to God to help you then LET IT GO. If you can NOT fix it now, you will only make yourself sick thinking about it.\nSeeker: I know. I can't seem to shut my mind down. And not getting sleep doesn't help\nHelper: It is much more difficult for me to remain focused and positive when I lose sleep. I have had to focus on self care, finding a friend to talk about my problems with, not someone who will TELL me what to do, but support me. So you need a good support system. And I find things like prayer, Bible reading, nice soft sheets to sleep on and some herbal tea like Sleepy Time help me relax before bedtime.\nSeeker: Those are some helpful points. I didn't think about herbal tea\nHelper: And be kind to yourself, no one likes to lose a job, it's unsettling. Do try to tell yourself things that are true to encourage yourself, like you will find another job, it might be uncomfortable and hard, but it actually might work out for your good in the long term. I always found better jobs, but at the time I lost my job, I felt as if the world was ending.\nSeeker: Yeah I am really concerned because my wife lost her job this summer so I'm the only breadwinner at the moment\nHelper: You aren't in an easy place, but this can actually work out for your good. I think if you focus on the GOOD that can happen, that might help your more. I would be concerned too, but if you even start looking for a job now, that might help you become more confident. I do encourage you to set goals. I have found that the hard times are often stepping stones to better things, however at the time, all it feels like is hard times! lol. I'm an older lady - I'm almost 60. So I've had a lot of jobs, retired now, but I remember when my husband kept getting threatened with job layoffs. It was really disheartening for him.\nSeeker: oh wow. yeah, I'm so stressed it's not funny\nHelper: If I had to do it over again, I would have encouraged him more to get that resume out and look for another job.

It took my daughter about 15 years to \"come back to me\" and now we have a close relationship again....so even if he seems to be drifting away know that it's normal and that will change in the future.\nSeeker: Good to know that from an experienced parent. I will try communicate my worries and my intensions to him. I hope he will understand and not pull away.\nHelper: And in the meantime remember to take extra good care of yourself :) Sometimes as moms we forget to do special things for ourselves. You are doing the hardest and most imporant job in the world so it's important to recognize that and reward yourself for it. I hope that conversation goes well for you, that you will have with him.\nSeeker: Thank you for your time and experienced advise.\nHelper: Oh you're so welcome, it's been a pleasure speaking with you.\n\n### Response:", "helper_index": 10, "conv_index": 50}, {"text": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nGive feedback to the Helper's last response.\n\n### Input:\nHelper: Oh I see. Apart from isolating how is he doing otherwise, like at school? Is he still seeing his friends at all? It can be scary not knowing what our kids are up to online.\nSeeker: Not really. He just has this one particular friend who comes over sometimes and they lock themselves in the room.\nHelper: Hmm. So a lot of mystery. I can understand you being worried. Is he your only child?\nSeeker: I am so scared I don't want to confront him I have always tried to show him how much I trust him as away to make him feel responsible enough. Yes. He is my only child and I am single parent\nHelper: Thats good parenting! Perhaps if you frame it as being about you, e.g. \"I am getting really worried, can you please explain....it's affecting me (affecting my sleep/work/whatever\" .... maybe it will inspire him to be more forthcoming. Any signs of depression? I have been depresed before, and self-isolating can be a symptom, I've been there...\nSeeker: Never thought of it that way. That could be a possibility. But he always seems happy and we chat a lot onlythat he his behind closed doors in his room for a long time everyday. Am also concerned about the friend who comes over. I don't really know his family or home just that he's from the neighborhood and they go to the same school.\nHelper: Hmm. My other thought is tell him what you just told me, that you have been trying to show him that you trust him....but be honest and tell him you are afraid. Hopefully, he won't want you feeling that way, and will open up a bit. Yes I can see that being concerning when you know nothing about the friend. Yet you walk a fine line because he needs the freedom and autonomy to choose his friends without explanation required...it's such a balancing act. I can tell you that I have raised a daughter, and that teen years were tougher than toddlerhood. Lots of worry, but she came through it and is fine now. I wonder if there is a teacher he is close to that you could bring your concerns to, perhaps the teacher may have some insight about yoru son to offer?\nSeeker: I find reassurance from your words. Its been tough for me this far we have come with my son and I want us to be close even as he growing up to become a young man.
