I thought people who were bi-polar contracted the illness earlier in their life.\nHelper: How long have you known about his bi polar diorder?\nSeeker: Around 10 months ago is when I first found out. Since then, I've received about 5 phone calls from people expressing concern. I've visited him 3 times. Thanks for being so engaged and sympathetic. It does make me feel better just to unload anonymously on here.

My friend Mark is suffering from bi-polar disorder, and despite being on medication, is spiraling out of control. His mood swings are affecting his ability to stay employed and keep friends and family from wanting to interact with him.\nHelper: I am so sorry about your friend mark. I will try my best to help you today. Is your friend mark behavior affecting you?\nSeeker: I suspect he's not taking his medication as prescribed. He's become a sociopath, which I understand is common with people suffering from this disorder. He's unable to be empathic or sympathetic to anyone else's life.\nHelper: To confirm your friend mark, you suspect he is not taking his medicine and that is why he is acting the way he is?\nSeeker: Yes, it is affecting me. In sum, I'm the only one left in his corner, but I feel like he's slipping away and becoming completely dysfunctional. It's tough with privacy laws for me to even talk to his doctor to see what's going on. I did send his doctor a long email, however, so hopefully he'll make whatever adjustments need to be made. That's my suspicion, because things seem to be getting worse, quite honestly.\nHelper: Have you talked to mark about his behavior and how it is affecting everyone around him? I can understand how you feeling and that you are trying to help your friend. you are a very good friend for doing that.\nSeeker: I have talked to him repeatedly. Each time, he assures me that he understands my concerns and that he's going to get things together. Literally, within a day or two, I hear from a mutual friend or family member that he's reverted back to doing things that are sociopathic.\nHelper: Have you asked him about him taking his medication?\nSeeker: I have. He tells me that he's taking it regularly (or most of the time). I challenged him on it and told him it can't be \"most of the time.\" That's why I sent his doctor a long email, explaining things to him, to see if he can't intervene and try to straighten him out.\nHelper: ok. dealing with someone with bi-polar disorder can be really tough and challenging but it is not there fault that they are acting the way they are. They just honestly can not help it. I know you are doing everything you can to help him and to stop him from acting that way.\nSeeker: You're right. Mental illness, in all of its forms, is especially challenging. Physical illness is more easy to understand, of course.\nHelper: you are right. So do not think he is doing it on purpose. Do not let it bring you down or hurt your feelings in anyway. When did this exactly start happening?\nSeeker: Thank you.

I know what to say almost word for word but I had a bad experience in the past that has scared me.\nHelper: I understand giving presentations is nervewrecking, but at least you are trying. Are you allowed to take a few notecards just in case?\nSeeker: Thanks for understanding, yeah I suppose I could take notes. I think it is being in front of people and looking foolish that I'm scared of the most. I know a lot of people at work and don;t want them to think I'm bad on stage. Can you related to that?\nHelper: I can definitely relate. It is best to look past the audience and just focus on an object close by. Everyone of us have had to experience this. You are not alone.\nSeeker: Hopefully I can try to get past the nerves, some people make it look easy. I'm usually really confident but something about standing on a stage makes me feel very scared and anxious.\nHelper: Before you go on, try taking a few deep breaths. Why not try meditating a few days before?\nSeeker: I could do I suppose. I won't be the only one presenting that day so I feel like I won't be able to measure up against the other people on stage.\nHelper: Try shifting the focus on what could go wrong, to what could go right? Focus on others congratulating you on a job well done.\nSeeker: Yeah I do have a tendency to be negative sometimes and make a big deal out of things. I should actually focus on the good things. Has this technique helped you in the past?\nHelper: Yes, in the term \"fake it until you make it.\" I keep on thinking of what could go right, or in my favor, and when I am done, it actually went okay, and any \"fears\" i had, never came to fruition.\nSeeker: I think that is really good advice. I think I have just suffered from a bad experience in the past and this has shaped my way of thinking to always be fearful. I'm fine in meetings or virtually but something about a stage just scares me.\nHelper: That's understandable. But now that you're aware, you have the steps the move forward and be successful.\nSeeker: yes I don't want it to hold me back personally or professionally any more\nHelper: I believe you can do it.\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": true, \"goodareas\": [\"Empathy\"]}", "helper_index": 9, "conv_index": 23}, {"text": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

Sadness and depresion can lead one to feel depleted and lacking motivation to make change. I have been depressed and lacking motivation in the past, I remember how it felt.\nSeeker: Yes, I see a psychologist and she does her best to help me but ultimately it is up to me to make the changes I need to in life.\nHelper: Is there anything about your position that you could suggest improving to your boss, to make your job more interesting? Maybe some ideas you may have for streamlining the work or somethings? I'm glad to hear you have someone to talk to about it. Over time as you keep working on it I hope things will improve for you.\nSeeker: I've spoke things over with my boss, he has tried a few things. Currently we are in a holding pattern due to some upper management changes and we are awaiting to see how the new manager would like to run things.\nHelper: oh I see. Do you have hobbies outside of work that you find fulfilling?\nSeeker: I have been slacking on that too. Just don't find pleasure in anything anymore. Now that it is spring time though hopefully that changes.\nHelper: Lets hope the new manager improves things for you, it sounds like there is a ray of hope there!. Yes it's hard to get started on anything when we are down. I remember writing lists with very small goals on them. Small goals feel like mountains when we are down! Then I would work my way through that very short list and check things off if I could do them, which gave me a small lift of accomplishment.\nSeeker: I should start writing lists. I know that is a great tool for helping.\nHelper: Lets hope the new manager can improve things. And your work with the psychologist is very positive, it's great you reached out for help, that is a strength. You've spoken with your boss. You are doing all the right things.\nSeeker: Thank you for the encouragement .\nHelper: you're very welcome, it's been a pleasure talking with you Larry.\nSeeker: Thank you for your help Sharon. Have a good day.\nHelper: you too! take good care of yourself, bye\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": true, \"goodareas\": [\"Structure\"]}", "helper_index": 11, "conv_index": 24}, {"text": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

I have been secretly watching his social media and he has girls asking him out and I don't want to let them get to him before I can get him back. I want to make it up to him somehow and do whatever he wants to get back together.\nHelper: you can always ask him calmly if he would like to talk, so you both have a chance to express your feelings in a safe way, with no yelling or arguing, do you think that's something he would do?\nSeeker: I can try that, I think he might be responsive at first if I dont set him off.

No, I don't think I have any regrets.\nHelper: I think I have said the same thing in a breakup so I wouldn't take that personal.\nSeeker: Yeah? I suppose people just say things when they are hurt.\nHelper: People say things they dont mean, or just say mean things to hurt because they are hurting. lol exactly.

I am so broken up and also disgusted from my break-up with my only long-term partner. I was so surprised by the hurtful things he said when we broke up I just don't know how to even manage my feelings about all the time we spent together.\nHelper: I am so sorry to hear that. I know how that feels. That is horrible he said hurtful things, but perhaps he didn't know how to manage what he was feeling. Was it a mutual breakup or did something happen?\nSeeker: Well, I suppose for him it came out of nowhere. But for me I just had slowly come to the realization that he was not the person for me. I fell out of love with him slowly and grew more annoyed by a lot of his behaviors. To me we were fighting a lot, and about dumb stuff like whether or not a salad is a meal. And I realized that we were fighting so much because I wanted him to eat healthier and be healthier and he was not going to change and it wasn't even right for me to change him if he didn't want help. So, I am sure he felt attacked and unattractive and so he lashed out at me.\nHelper: Realizing someone isn't the same you fell in love with seems valid. Fighting over a salad is definately not something most couples argue over. He probably did feel attacked, but I am sure he noticed the continual fighting as well.
