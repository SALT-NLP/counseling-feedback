A decade ago, I might have talked to her mom about it, but her mom is now frail herself, and her own husband is a lot to handle. I feel protective of my aunt, too. I almost feel like her counselor doesn't do much good for her, but I know there are different styles of therapy... I feel like the therapist just echoes back to her how awful her husband is, etc (he's not really that bad, but they've grown apart). But if I ever say anything like this, she just doesn't speak to me for weeks. I know I need to try to approach the topic with her. It would be better in person, but that's not easy now.

He's unable to be empathic or sympathetic to anyone else's life.\nHelper: To confirm your friend mark, you suspect he is not taking his medicine and that is why he is acting the way he is?\nSeeker: Yes, it is affecting me. In sum, I'm the only one left in his corner, but I feel like he's slipping away and becoming completely dysfunctional. It's tough with privacy laws for me to even talk to his doctor to see what's going on. I did send his doctor a long email, however, so hopefully he'll make whatever adjustments need to be made. That's my suspicion, because things seem to be getting worse, quite honestly.\nHelper: Have you talked to mark about his behavior and how it is affecting everyone around him? I can understand how you feeling and that you are trying to help your friend. you are a very good friend for doing that.\nSeeker: I have talked to him repeatedly. Each time, he assures me that he understands my concerns and that he's going to get things together. Literally, within a day or two, I hear from a mutual friend or family member that he's reverted back to doing things that are sociopathic.\nHelper: Have you asked him about him taking his medication?\nSeeker: I have. He tells me that he's taking it regularly (or most of the time). I challenged him on it and told him it can't be \"most of the time.\" That's why I sent his doctor a long email, explaining things to him, to see if he can't intervene and try to straighten him out.\nHelper: ok. dealing with someone with bi-polar disorder can be really tough and challenging but it is not there fault that they are acting the way they are. They just honestly can not help it. I know you are doing everything you can to help him and to stop him from acting that way.\nSeeker: You're right. Mental illness, in all of its forms, is especially challenging. Physical illness is more easy to understand, of course.\nHelper: you are right. So do not think he is doing it on purpose. Do not let it bring you down or hurt your feelings in anyway. When did this exactly start happening?\nSeeker: Thank you. I think you understand the sadness and anxiety in feeling powerless in this situation (or mostly powerless). I have no real expertise in this area, but by contacting his doctor, maybe he can reevaluate whether the medicine and dosage needs to be changed. Funny you ask. He's a grown man - 35-years old. I've never known him to have this issue, which seems so strange to me.\nHelper: I understand a lot.\nSeeker: It started about 14 months ago - at least that's when people started alerting me to strange behavior. I thought people who were bi-polar contracted the illness earlier in their life.\nHelper: How long have you known about his bi polar diorder?\nSeeker: Around 10 months ago is when I first found out. Since then, I've received about 5 phone calls from people expressing concern. I've visited him 3 times. Thanks for being so engaged and sympathetic. It does make me feel better just to unload anonymously on here. Thanks for carrying my burden and offering your support.\nHelper: i got you. having a mental illness is challenging and i can provide you some suggestions.\nSeeker: Before we end the conversation, I'd love hearing a few of those suggestions, if you don't mind.\nHelper: ok. just be there for him no matter what because you know he can not help it. Be understanding of his mental illness. i would be active in his treatment and make sure he knows to take medicine.\nSeeker: Thank you. You've been great. Have a nice holiday and new year!. Those are two things I've tried to keep in mind and you've reinforced my instincts. Thanks again.\nHelper: no problem. Have a nice holiday to and remain safe. Do not give up on your friend. Everything will get better for him.\n\n### Response:", "helper_index": 11, "conv_index": 20}, {"text": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

How is that affecting you?\nSeeker: I am pretty sad about it and the entire situation.\nHelper: I'm so sorry that you feel sad about the situation.\nSeeker: Thanks. I am focused on moving on and figuring my life out, but I feel like it's causing me to neglect other important aspects of my life.\nHelper: What makes you think you are neglecting other important aspects in your life?\nSeeker: I am also a student in my Masters program, and I haven't been paying attention as closely as I was before.\nHelper: That sounds difficult. You sound like a strong person still persevering in your Masters even through this difficult time even if you can't pay attention as closely as before.\nSeeker: It is difficult. I am trying hard but I have been having a tough time, especially now that I have been searching for a new place to live.\nHelper: I remember a bad breakup too where I wasn't sure how the future would go.

If you feel it wont get anywhere, give her some space and come back to it at another date if you think you both would be comfortable with it.\nSeeker: Okay. I think that sounds good.

Like she's the type who would not back down. and she's lost many friends and romanics partners that way. So I feel like she's not going to unblock me and get back together. I'm just really upset because I want to call her off, not because I lost a friendship.

Have you noticed it could be related to that or simply the amount of alcohol you are drinking?\nSeeker: It is typically the amount I'm drinking, but cutting out drinking as a whole has probably helped me the most.\nHelper: Certainly making sure that you only drink a certain amount like a couple drinks of beer or only a shot of harder drinks might alleviate this or refraining from mixing drinks. Sometimes also it could be due to the company you keep...the amount you drink. Do your friends encourage you to drink more?\nSeeker: They don't necessarily attempt to get me to drink more in volume, but I do have to tell them I'm not gonna go out for the night.\nHelper: Are they okay with it when you decline?\nSeeker: Yes after one or two statements they give up.\nHelper: Okay so they ask you a couple of times and then they move on. That's good that they don't push you too much. Certainly keep with it if not drinking helps you to not make bad decisions. I'm sure you have other interests in life that maybe you could drag your friends out to enjoy so that might help...sober fun! Also if you find that you're struggling with not drinking that might be a time to look for support. Maybe see a therapist as there may be psychological reasons you can not refrain from drinking. Maybe look into a group like AA or something similar to share your struggles with others.\n\n### Response:", "helper_index": 9, "conv_index": 77}, {"text": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

Are there any official routes that you can use to complain?\nSeeker: I work in supply chain and I see the actual sales numbers and realized 4 months ago that we were actually on track to exceed our plans, even with the covid reductions. a few weeks later I heard him tell our sales director to keep the numbers artificially low so that they will both get their bonuses.

It is normal to be upset in a situation like this. When I ask if there is someone to talk to, I meant perhaps a friend or someone who has experienced a similar breakup. There are also support groups out there that can really help. Getting your emotions out and seeing that others struggle with the same issue may be a very good thing.\nSeeker: Have you ever had a break up of a serious relationship or know someone who has? Does the aching inside ever get better? How long will it take?\nHelper: When I was younger, my girlfriend cheated on me. We were together for 4 years. For me, it turned to anger not sadness, I was so angry that she did that to me. I realised that if she was capable of doing this, it's better that I found out now, rather than when we were engaged or married. I loved her but after she cheated, I couldn't stand the sight of her. I completely understand the feelings you are experiencing. The good news is that I have since met someone wonderful, we have children and I am now very happy.\nSeeker: I am sorry that happened to you but glad it turned out well in the end. You have a good point that it is better to know now than after we got married. I do have a nice neighbor who expressed concern when he noticed my boyfriend was gone. He said if I ever needed someone to talk to he was there. I thought he was just being nice. Maybe I should go talk to him some time maybe he was sincere.\nHelper: I think that that would be a good idea! for info, In terms of how long it takes to get over it. I have read a statistic that is takes half the length of the relationship to truly get over it. Personally I think it does depend on the person and how things end in terms of the breakup.\nSeeker: Thank you for checking on that for me, I hope it is quicker I would hate to feel this way that long. I think I will go see him he is home right now. You have made me feel hopeful and that there will be an end to these feelings and maybe things will go as well for me as they did you.

In my experience at times we need to be single for self growth and I have found that personal growth usual thrives when I am single.\nSeeker: That's what I hope for. I just can't get over missing my partner because they were great to me, I just needed to be alone.\nHelper: I think you are feeling a loss even though you feel that at this time you need to be alone to focus on your own growth. When you had the conversation about this breakup were you honest about why you need the space and that your problem was not with the relationship but with maybe the timing. I think with communication and after growth perhaps by keeping the door open with this person maybe you can have some sort of relationship in the future even if its friendship or maybe more. You are doing what is right for yourself at the given time\nSeeker: I did get the chance to explain my reasons a few days after the breakup. We were friendly and talked casually for a few more days and then they said they needed to space to get themselves together. We haven't really talked since then. The problem is I'm open to something in the future but I don't know that they are and I can't find the courage to ask\nHelper: I have been in both situations before the one who needed space and also as the one who was broken up with. I think right now the best thing you can do for you and the person is to stick with your decision and give them time they also may need space to process and deal with the breakup and growth for themselves without really letting go you won't be able to grow in time you can have a conversation and ask but it might be six months down the road wait for them to come to you they have asked for time as you did too soon\nSeeker: I think I can do that. They needed space because it was hard going from being in a relationship to being friends in a matter of days. I guess I'll just have to continue working on myself and see how things go\nHelper: Focusing on yourself sounds like the best thing you can do. Start on that list of self improvements you want to make. Connect with friends you may have lost touch with. Your going to be great\nSeeker: I like that idea. Thank you for your help!\nHelper: Your welcome and I love that you are so dedicated to your development\n\n### Response:", "helper_index": 8, "conv_index": 131}, {"text": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.
