I think you understand the sadness and anxiety in feeling powerless in this situation (or mostly powerless). I have no real expertise in this area, but by contacting his doctor, maybe he can reevaluate whether the medicine and dosage needs to be changed. Funny you ask. He's a grown man - 35-years old. I've never known him to have this issue, which seems so strange to me.\nHelper: I understand a lot.\nSeeker: It started about 14 months ago - at least that's when people started alerting me to strange behavior. I thought people who were bi-polar contracted the illness earlier in their life.\nHelper: How long have you known about his bi polar diorder?\nSeeker: Around 10 months ago is when I first found out. Since then, I've received about 5 phone calls from people expressing concern. I've visited him 3 times. Thanks for being so engaged and sympathetic. It does make me feel better just to unload anonymously on here. Thanks for carrying my burden and offering your support.\nHelper: i got you. having a mental illness is challenging and i can provide you some suggestions.\nSeeker: Before we end the conversation, I'd love hearing a few of those suggestions, if you don't mind.\nHelper: ok. just be there for him no matter what because you know he can not help it. Be understanding of his mental illness. i would be active in his treatment and make sure he knows to take medicine.\nSeeker: Thank you. You've been great. Have a nice holiday and new year!. Those are two things I've tried to keep in mind and you've reinforced my instincts. Thanks again.\nHelper: no problem. Have a nice holiday to and remain safe. Do not give up on your friend.

The reason was I refused to hang out with her during covid and she questioned our friendship. Something she said was \"It's selfish of me to work rather than spend time with a special friend.\".

But I cannot because she blocked me on everything.\nHelper: Have you explained to her that you NEED to work, and don't be upset with yourself because you did the right thing. If your friendship was strong she will surely unblock you. Give her time to cool down\nSeeker: Yeah I did. And she just got more upset and said I was selfish. Like she's the type who would not back down. and she's lost many friends and romanics partners that way. So I feel like she's not going to unblock me and get back together. I'm just really upset because I want to call her off, not because I lost a friendship.

So I went to McDonald's and pick up the order and took it to the right address and after a few hours I notice that the client did not confirm the order.\nHelper: I am not knowledgeable in this service industry. Let me understand. You delivered the order, but the customer did not confirm they wanted it.\nSeeker: Five minutes later my supervisor called me saying that the client call and reported that he did not received his order. And that's not true at all, I gave him the food. So now i don't know if they going to fired me or let me keep the job\nHelper: Oh i understand, that would be annoying. Did you talk to your supervisor about this situation?\nSeeker: Of course I did. He told me he going to give me the benefit of the doubt but that is not enough. Im an honest person and this kind of accusation makes me feel very bad\nHelper: I understand, but do not feel bad about yourself. You did your work honestly and delivered the food to your customer. Can I suggest something moving forward?\nSeeker: Yes. But stuff like that makes me look bad and makes people dont trust me. Sure. That can help. I would appreciate it\nHelper: Maybe every time you make a delivery, you can take a picture of it for proof. or maybe you can have a copy of the receipt and have the customer sign it as well.\nSeeker: Well. I normally take pictures of every delivery I make but I let this pass and look what happened\nHelper: it's okay, it happens to everyone. we are human and we tend to make the smallest mistakes. The important thing is to learn from them. Is there anything else bothering you at work?\nSeeker: Yes. It won't happen again for sure. This makes me dont trust people again. Well. This is the first time I ever faced this kind of problem at work\nHelper: as long as you believe in yourself to be honest, don't worry about what other people think. Your boss will come to understand you are a honest worker. It is also amazing that you have come such a long way without having other problems. that is great!\nSeeker: I know but sometimes one small thing can hurt you and ruined the reputation that you had build for a long time\nHelper: Yes, i understand what you are saying.

Im scared that if I continue to work, Im putting him in danger. But if I stop, I can no longer afford bills. My son just turned 2.\nHelper: I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you'd wish they wear a mask?\nSeeker: I have. A few people respected my wishes. But one in particular stands out. A gentleman who told me he had a medical condition and proceeded to get in my face. He got angry at my request. In my shoes, what would you do? Because I feel like Im stuck between a rock and a hard place lol\nHelper: I understand how you feel. Can you tell me a little more about how it makes you feel when they don't honor your requests?\nSeeker: It makes me feel trapped. Frustrated. I would never intentionally try to put someone else in harms way and I feel like I don t. *don't get the same courtesy. I feel frustrated because I'm REQUIRED to deal with people. I work in construction. I feel trapped because, what are my options? Continue to work.....my son gets sick and dies. His pediatrician has already warned me how deadly this could be for me. And if I quit? No money? I have a 5 year old I have to take care of too.\nHelper: I can see exactly how frustrated you are in this situation. Before I share some ideas do you have any ideas of ways to combat this issue?\nSeeker: I've spoken to my boss. He was sympathetic about it all....At this point I'm not sure what to do.\nHelper: Alright. Have you talked to your boss about working in areas where you can be around people less? Or possibly going part time for now and finding a lob that puts less danger on you and your family?\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": false, \"goodareas\": [], \"feedback\": \"The goal is to provide empathetic support and validate the seeker's emotions.
