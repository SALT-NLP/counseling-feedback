**Conversation**

Helper: Hello. How are you doing today?
Seeker: Feeling pretty down to be honest.
Helper: Oh, I am sorry about that. Why are you feeling down?
Seeker: I'm just really lonely. My friends are all very busy lately and I haven't been able to find a partner for a long time.
Helper: I can understand that. It is difficult feeling alone.
Seeker: Yes. Normally it's not so bad but it's been such going on for such a long time. It's harder to deal with after so many years.
Helper: It sounds like you feel your friends are too busy for you.
Seeker: Yes, but the biggest part is not being able to find romantic partner.
Helper: Why do you think you are having trouble finding a suitable romantic partner?
Seeker: Part because of my low income and part because of my age. I live in a college town and most single women are 10 years younger than me.
Helper: Sometimes meeting people through mutual friends is helpful. Have you asked any of your friends if they could introduce to you people they know?
